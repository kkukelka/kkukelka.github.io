It’s that my body has developed this weird talent to almost accurately synchronize the time it requires to ingest a given meal with the exact episode length of whatever tv show I happen to watch at that moment. The 3 minutes and 25 seconds was what’s left of an episode of Southpark I had started watching earlier that day. Currently catching up on the latest season. I have to say that I’m quite disappointed by the lackluster content of recent seasons. What I used to consider the pinnacle of thought-provoking satire and social commentary, nowadays often fails to live up to its former glory, effectively turning the show into nothing more than a lazy recapitulation of current events.\nAnywho, thanks to my inner demons, I couldn’t just watch the rest of the episode like a normal person would do. No, I needed to superset the given visual experience with yet another hedonistic stimulus. My rational is being hijacked by my insatiable cravings for that sweet-tasting sensation, despite me being fully aware of the ramifications such actions will have on my overall well-being.

You’d think I was exaggerating here, but during my first few years at university, I genuinely struggled to maintain a grip on my self-control. To a point at which 3 bars of chocolate a day had become the norm. Even if it was way past closing time of any nearby convenience store, I‘d always find a way to get my daily dose of sugar. Whether that meant stopping by some random gas station in the middle of nowhere (mind you I don’t own a car), or making the pilgrimage to a 24/7 supermarket at the nearest train station. None of which are locations you want to find yourself at in the middle of the night. The scenery, composed mostly of functional alcoholics, stranded tourists and pale-skinned night shift workers, was sorrowing at best. That didn’t stop me, however, from becoming a regular visitor of said establishments. On a good day, I settled with 2 bars of Milka, with at least one of them having to be the flavor featuring Lefèvre-Utile biscuits inside. The one with the prominent red-coloured wave on its packaging. If I had to choose, I‘d make it my contestant for the greatest food brand collaboration in existence. 87 grams of perfection.

It feels like when faced with situations that guarantee some sort of immediate relieve, the human mind is almost programmed to indulge in the temptation. When looking at the environment our ancestors had to survive in, roaming the planes of the South African wetlands, it stands to reason why we developed such tendencies in the first place. Back then, food was a necessity, rather than the hedonistic activity it has become today. One had to seize every opportunity to obtain sustenance, as scarcity and uncertainty were ever-present. But with the arrival of the Industrial Age, the invention of ever more capable machinery and ultimately the advancements in food manufacturing and preservation, humanity has effectively outpaced the speed of evolution in a matter of centuries.

Pointing your finger at the next best industry giant won’t aid you in pulling yourself out of your misery, as the suffering that plagues you is entirely self-inflicted. At its core, the modern culinary landscape is nothing more than a reflection of the collective demand. If you ever wondered why something like Hershey‘s giant 5 pound bar exists, it is because someone is willing to pay money for it. That’s just how consumer markets tend to work. Way more interesting to decipher are the motivational factors behind such purchases, which are rooted deeply in the way in which Western society puts consumerism above all. A mental construct that has been fed to the masses since the 18th century, as a means to counteract the overproduction of goods. Ever since, our day-to-day life and social norms have been meticulously tailored to fit this given narrative, making us utilize the act of consumption as a coping mechanism to fill the void that everyday life leaves us with.

It was at this moment that the rest of the party arrived.

Frustrated by the limited set of options to choose from, I simply opted for the first vegan item I could find in the menu.",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":123,"children":124},{},[125],{"type":28,"value":126},"The level of frustration I felt when the food finally arrived was just equally as bad. What I was presented with was a tiny portion of cauliflower florets, a few pieces of pumpernickel bread, drenched in a thick, hollandaise-like sauce. Sprinkled on top, a handful of hazelnuts and two strings of saffron. I didn’t even mind that most of the meal was served cold. After all, gas prices had been surging throughout the past year. What did bewilder me though was the taste of the food, or rather the lack thereof. Hear me out, I really gave it a shot. I genuinely was looking forward to experience the culinary sensation I was being sold on. First I mixed the hazelnuts with the cauliflower, then with the bread, then all of them together in a single bite. Sure, some of the combinations of flavours may be described as peculiar and even mildly interesting, but ultimately I was left puzzled at how a human above the age of five would be able to derive any form of pleasure from this pile of seemingly arbitrary ingredients.",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":128,"children":129},{},[130],{"type":28,"value":131},"Even my trip to the mens room was more of a revelation than the food I just had ingested, as I happened to eavesdrop on one of the tables I passed by. The couple had just been handed their receipt. A whopping sum of 240€. Two hundred forty euros! Have these two gentlemen been inhaling gold dust for the past 2 hours? I guess part of this financial abuse is being accounted for when being told by the minimum wage waitress how the minuscule slice of wagyu beef had been hand-massaged by a cohort of Tibetan monks before being flown half across the globe just to be devoured by a twenty-something year old junior business consultant with a self-acclaimed interest for fine dining despite ever having touched his 500$ Japanese knife set he bought himself for Christmas.",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":133,"children":134},{},[135],{"type":28,"value":136},"I returned from my roundtrip shortly after. Just in time for dessert. Of course, the way in which the dishes were served also had to have some sort of „creative“ spin to it. What resulted could have been a scene out of a David Lynch movie. The appearance was almost as insulting as the food itself. The peach-coloured sorbet was to be eaten out of a tiny aluminium can, which originally was used as a storage container for sun-dried tomatoes. How do I know? Well, the hideous looking label of some no-name Slavic food producer still was attached to it. Presumably the chef’s attempt to convey a sense of frugality or pragmatism. Anywho - there I was with this ominous looking can and the sorbet inside of it. The latter looking like the partially digested form of what was initially kept in the former. To my surprise, it did in fact taste like peaches.",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":138,"children":139},{},[140],{"type":28,"value":141},"Once again, I found myself dumbfounded by my inability to parse the world the way other people did. Could it have been the case that it was me who was lacking the sensibility to truly appreciate the level of craftsmanship that I was presented with? But how? Not to sound brash here, but I would consider my sense of taste as rather developed. I love to eat. I love to cook. And I enjoy experimenting with the way I prepare my food. Every meal of mine is treated like a ritual and if I’m being honest, food is the only thing in life that I truly appreciate and look forward to.",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":143,"children":144},{},[145],{"type":28,"value":146},"It rather appears to me that frequent guests of such establishments take the hefty price tag as a means to justify that what they just shoved down their throat must have been a moment of culinary excellence. I hate to break it to you, but if your eating habits revolve around DoorDash, the local Starbucks drive-in and your vocal distaste for „Chinese food“, I can see how such mediocre prepared meals might lead you to believe that your sensations were somewhat profound.

But I'm certain that if I don’t take action now, every day that goes by will just be another attempt to catch my own tail. Putting my thoughts and emotions down into words seems like the only valid approach to finally come to peace with my inner demon. The issue at hand, and the very topic I seek to deconstruct throughout writing this essay, is my relationship with painting. Somewhere along the way of acquiring this new skill of mine, I've somehow managed to turn this most sacred form of expression into an act of desperation. A misconfiguration of sorts, disabling me from experiencing the true nature of the craft.",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":176,"children":177},{},[178],{"type":28,"value":179},"The root cause for this crisis of mine is that no matter from which angle I choose to approach the subject, I simply cannot seem to find enjoyment in the activity. Sure, on the occasion there comes a moment that could be described as a feeling of proudness or a sense of accomplishment, yet they are spread so sparsely that I have a hard time coping with the dry spells that come in between. Hence, the artistic journey has become somewhat of an uphill battle to me, with the only thing keeping me going being the satisfaction I receive upon finishing a piece. Throughout the process itself, however, I either find myself in a state of complete apathy or at the beginning of a nervous breakdown. At first I thought this to be just the initial barrier one typically faces when picking up something new. Though after now two years of trial and error, I've come to the sobering realisation that my disconnectedness to the craft cannot be simply ascribed to a lack of proficiency or discipline, but emerges from the depths of my inner workings and the way I naturally tend to interface with the world.",{"type":23,"tag":164,"props":181,"children":183},{"id":182},"creative-deconstruction",[184],{"type":28,"value":185},"Creative Deconstruction",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":187,"children":188},{},[189],{"type":28,"value":190},"What exactly is it that pushes me to pick up my pen if I know for certain that all I'm going to be faced with is a barricade of boredom and exhaustion? Why is it that I need to force myself to paint, even though I romanticise the idea of being an artist? Writing it out like this is making me question the reason of why I embarked on this journey in the first place. Perhaps the aspiration of becoming this idealised version of myself simply isn't enough of an incitement to keep myself motivated on a long-term basis. It's the emphasis on \"becoming\" that seems to distract me from living in the present moment. A disoriented state of mind that is purely centered around the completion of egocentric objectives, leaving no room to fathom the beauty of the creative process.",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":192,"children":193},{},[194],{"type":28,"value":195},"If I'm being honest, not a single painting of mine has been started out of necessity to express myself, nor has it served me as an outlet to work through my emotions. That isn’t to say one cannot create in absence of aforementioned reasons. It’s just that for me personally, not having an inherent urge to devote myself to the matter on a day-to-day basis let’s painting become a chore rather than something I look forward to do. What has emerged is a state of disorientation. A toxic cycle that, through its deceptive prospects of fame and success, manages to keep me stuck in place. I genuinely believe, however, that the given situation is not a product of a lack of discipline and that vigorously trying to rewire myself just for the off-chance of finding enjoyment is not to be considered an appropriate response to the dilemma I’m facing. That is because in virtually every other aspect of my life, these character traits of mine give me an edge I don’t want to miss. More often than not, I truly appreciate and welcome the way my brain tends to parse and process my surroundings. My mind is, and always has been, a captive to short-term gratification. Even if that means that my pursuits are primarily guided by shortsighted motives, it is a trait that I don’t want to sacrifice.",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":197,"children":198},{},[199],{"type":28,"value":200},"Hence, I find myself at a crossroads of either trying to reframe my approach to painting as a whole or to discover a more fitting creative outlet all together.
