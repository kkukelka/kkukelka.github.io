This all thanks to my most curious and indecisive nature, making life appear as if it were an all-inclusive buffet, presenting me with a myriad of delicacies I have yet to indulge in. From the humble beginnings of me wanting to become a composer for TV and film, to my unavailing odyssey through the mysterious realms of painting, it is now that I find myself sitting here at my desk, with nothing but a pen and a blank piece of paper lying in front of me.

Unlike its rather demanding siblings, the medium of writing is surprisingly easy to please. As long as you have a pulse and bring along some basic knowledge of the English grammar, you are free to express whatever you deem worthwhile. Whether I am doing my laundry or waiting in line at the grocery store, its omnipresence accompanies my every waking moment.

I now find myself in obeisance to a higher power, urging me to transcribe, document, and collect any crumb of inspiration life chooses to throw my way. So much so, that I do not dare to leave my apartment without carrying some sort of notebook with me. Scattered across my room, pages upon pages filled with unfinished short stories and uncharted narratives. Hundreds of hastily-typed notes collecting virtual dust on my phone. While every now and then, this compulsion of mine can feel somewhat burdensome and exhausting, given a society of excess and overabundance, what more could one ask for than a sense of necessity? When a particular constellation of words or a most poignant way to describe, makes you leap out of bed in the middle of the night, determined to save it from forever being lost in the boundless void of the human mind."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:blog:beyond-pastels-and-tremolos.md","_source":"content","_file":"blog/beyond-pastels-and-tremolos.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/blog/resisting-the-dark-arts-of-big-sugar","_dir":"blog","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Resisting The Dark Arts of Big Sugar","description":"Dear creator of the universe, what vicious notion has driven you to bestow us with this plant that is the cocoa tree.

Like with so many other consumable goods that let us temporarily alter our perceived state of being, the opportunistic minds of the corporate world couldn’t help themselves but to start profiting off of our unfortunate evolutionary trait. And it‘s the ease with which they are able to enslave us, that makes it so frustrating to watch our growing inability to cope with the malicious practices found in modern consumer markets.

Be it as a gift for a loved one or as a cure for one of those moody days, it’s allure has captivated the hearts and souls of most everyone around us.

Despite its pretty high cocoa content of around 85%, typically resulting in a taste profile consisting mostly of bitter and earthy notes, the bar not only manages to pull off the soft creamy texture of its milk-based siblings, but also overwhelmed me with its surprisingly sweet aroma. So much so that it had me check the food label twice. I couldn’t fathom how this thing was supposed to contain only 14 grams of sugar, but there was no trickery to be found. Just 5 simple ingredients, consisting of sugar, vanilla and various cocoa solids, with no trace of artificial sweeteners in sight. A showcase of true craftsmanship."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Just this Saturday I‘ve devoured one of them in a record time of 3 minutes and 25 seconds. Perhaps I should bring to your attention that I didn’t try to set a new record (low) for myself here. It’s that my body has developed this weird talent to almost accurately synchronize the time it requires to ingest a given meal with the exact episode length of whatever tv show I happen to watch at that moment. The 3 minutes and 25 seconds was what’s left of an episode of Southpark I had started watching earlier that day. Currently catching up on the latest season. I have to say that I’m quite disappointed by the lackluster content of recent seasons. What I used to consider the pinnacle of thought-provoking satire and social commentary, nowadays often fails to live up to its former glory, effectively turning the show into nothing more than a lazy recapitulation of current events.\nAnywho, thanks to my inner demons, I couldn’t just watch the rest of the episode like a normal person would do. No, I needed to superset the given visual experience with yet another hedonistic stimulus. My rational is being hijacked by my insatiable cravings for that sweet-tasting sensation, despite me being fully aware of the ramifications such actions will have on my overall well-being. The slightly frantic state it leaves me in, the inevitable effect it will have one my sleep hygiene, the metabolic repercussions of consuming large amounts of highly refined sugar and saturated fats. All of this for a few minutes’ worth of pleasure."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It’s fascinating to observe what lengths my body is willing to go to just so it can experience a bunch of glucose molecules rushing through its bloodstream, reminiscent of Hollywood’s depiction of a heroine addict looking for his next fix. You’d think I was exaggerating here, but during my first few years at university, I genuinely struggled to maintain a grip on my self-control. To a point at which 3 bars of chocolate a day had become the norm. Even if it was way past closing time of any nearby convenience store, I‘d always find a way to get my daily dose of sugar. Whether that meant stopping by some random gas station in the middle of nowhere (mind you I don’t own a car), or making the pilgrimage to a 24/7 supermarket at the nearest train station. None of which are locations you want to find yourself at in the middle of the night. The scenery, composed mostly of functional alcoholics, stranded tourists and pale-skinned night shift workers, was sorrowing at best. That didn’t stop me, however, from becoming a regular visitor of said establishments. On a good day, I settled with 2 bars of Milka, with at least one of them having to be the flavor featuring Lefèvre-Utile biscuits inside. The one with the prominent red-coloured wave on its packaging. If I had to choose, I‘d make it my contestant for the greatest food brand collaboration in existence. 87 grams of perfection. My favorite part was to nibble off the chocolate that surrounded each of the buscuit pieces. Saving up the salty parts for last gave me the needed palette cleanse to not get fatigued by the tidal wave of sweetness that had just swept through my mouth."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What was initially thought of as a way of rewarding myself for surviving yet another day in the shit show that is the academic system, gradually evolved into a toxic habit that seized control of my daily life. While I perfectly well understood that my excessive consumption habits would eventually take a toll on my well-being, I was past the point at which I could still bargain with my inner voice. It took a series of rather serious health complications for me to muster enough willpower to finally break free from my compulsive behaviour.

It feels like when faced with situations that guarantee some sort of immediate relieve, the human mind is almost programmed to indulge in the temptation. When looking at the environment our ancestors had to survive in, roaming the planes of the South African wetlands, it stands to reason why we developed such tendencies in the first place. Back then, food was a necessity, rather than the hedonistic activity it has become today. One had to seize every opportunity to obtain sustenance, as scarcity and uncertainty were ever-present. But with the arrival of the Industrial Age, the invention of ever more capable machinery and ultimately the advancements in food manufacturing and preservation, humanity has effectively outpaced the speed of evolution in a matter of centuries. Imposed upon our primal instincts is now the insurmountable task of helping us steer through an environment of overabundance."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Though it should be noted, that this constant availability isn't harmful per se. It was the introduction of highly processed, calorie dense food products into our diet, that has put society into disarray. I know what you might be thinking right now, but i ask you to not let your emotions cloud your judgement. Pointing your finger at the next best industry giant won’t aid you in pulling yourself out of your misery, as the suffering that plagues you is entirely self-inflicted. At its core, the modern culinary landscape is nothing more than a reflection of the collective demand. If you ever wondered why something like Hershey‘s giant 5 pound bar exists, it is because someone is willing to pay money for it. That’s just how consumer markets tend to work. Way more interesting to decipher are the motivational factors behind such purchases, which are rooted deeply in the way in which Western society puts consumerism above all. A mental construct that has been fed to the masses since the 18th century, as a means to counteract the overproduction of goods. Ever since, our day-to-day life and social norms have been meticulously tailored to fit this given narrative, making us utilize the act of consumption as a coping mechanism to fill the void that everyday life leaves us with. Wouldn't it be wonderful if simply being conscious of this predicament was enough to break free from it?

It’s like us Westerners can’t help ourselves but to take consumerism to a degree at which it starts to become a parody of itself. We’ve managed to morph something as mundane as the act of food consumption into a classist system of oppression. In our modern-day food culture mere eating is to be considered an activity for peasants. Only those of us who’ve acquired the necessary financial means are worthy of participating in the world of dining. But I believe I’m getting ahead of myself here.

Sifting through the first few pages it dawned upon me what I’ve manoeuvred myself into. This wasn’t just your average woke fusion kitchen. This was meant to be an experience. A culinary triathlon if you will. My curiosity, however, faded away in an instant when I came to realise that none of their multi course meals were suitable for devout followers of a plant based diet. It was at this moment that the rest of the party arrived. The waiter was quick to take our orders, but before we could even say a word, we were being subjected to a 5 minute monologue about the exquisite selection of drinks that they had in store for us. The brash and presumptuous undertone to his suggestions was so blatantly obvious that I couldn’t even be mad about it. And to his defence, he was nothing but a pawn in the game of chess that had been going on since the moment I had stepped foot into the place.

What did bewilder me though was the taste of the food, or rather the lack thereof. Hear me out, I really gave it a shot. I genuinely was looking forward to experience the culinary sensation I was being sold on. First I mixed the hazelnuts with the cauliflower, then with the bread, then all of them together in a single bite. Sure, some of the combinations of flavours may be described as peculiar and even mildly interesting, but ultimately I was left puzzled at how a human above the age of five would be able to derive any form of pleasure from this pile of seemingly arbitrary ingredients."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Even my trip to the mens room was more of a revelation than the food I just had ingested, as I happened to eavesdrop on one of the tables I passed by.

I guess part of this financial abuse is being accounted for when being told by the minimum wage waitress how the minuscule slice of wagyu beef had been hand-massaged by a cohort of Tibetan monks before being flown half across the globe just to be devoured by a twenty-something year old junior business consultant with a self-acclaimed interest for fine dining despite ever having touched his 500$ Japanese knife set he bought himself for Christmas."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I returned from my roundtrip shortly after.

The appearance was almost as insulting as the food itself. The peach-coloured sorbet was to be eaten out of a tiny aluminium can, which originally was used as a storage container for sun-dried tomatoes. How do I know? Well, the hideous looking label of some no-name Slavic food producer still was attached to it. Presumably the chef’s attempt to convey a sense of frugality or pragmatism.
