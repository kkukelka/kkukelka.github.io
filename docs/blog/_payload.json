When looking at the environment our ancestors had to survive in, roaming the planes of the South African wetlands, it stands to reason why we developed such tendencies in the first place.

Way more interesting to decipher are the motivational factors behind such purchases, which are rooted deeply in the way in which Western society puts consumerism above all. A mental construct that has been fed to the masses since the 18th century, as a means to counteract the overproduction of goods.

In order to peek through the endless amounts of content that we are drowning in, it has now become a necessity to copy. This trend is not only a burden for the unconscious mind of the end consumer, but also a concrete block on the feet of the creators who just want to elevate their skill set to the next level. Big players now encourage familiarity over originality due to the high financial risks associated with the production of triple A content. And this distinct level of familiarity is just enough of a dopamine hit to keep you on the hook. Just enough to keep you satisfied for the moment. But the sensation of experiencing something truly out of the blue is fading, just as our individuality surrendering to the tasteless amalgamation of repetitive content that will eventually lead to the incremental collapse of the traits that make us unique.",{"type":23,"tag":195,"props":565,"children":567},{"id":566},"escaping-to-creative-outlets",[568],{"type":28,"value":569},"Escaping to creative outlets",{"type":23,"tag":24,"props":571,"children":572},{},[573],{"type":28,"value":574},"One of the positive side effects of such realisations is the freedom it gives to one's pursuits in life. In a world where survival is taken out of the equation, every path you take seems equally valuable (or rather expendable) for society. I believe we have arrived at a point, where creative tasks can be more valuable to yourself and your surroundings than a high tier position in a corporate setting. Both scenarios allow you to have some level of autonomy over the choices you make, but in my eyes the process of executing such decisions affects your deepest self in a totally different way. While the result of your business decisions can be measured through various performance metrics, the outcomes of pure creative pursuits are beyond such measurements - leaving the like economy of social media out of the picture for now. It resembles the true voice of a human being. An image of one's essence. An outlet to fill the emptiness of consumerism.
