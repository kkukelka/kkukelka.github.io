And while the winds are gentle and the waters are calm, it just doesn't feel right. It's not necessarily the actual work that I'm doing, but the emptiness that it leaves behind. Even though I'm providing value for the team and the project I'm a part of, I am not able to appreciate my doings on a personal level. This problem, however, comes along with a much bigger issue our society faces. Overabundance. Not only an overabundance of food and shelter necessary for our survival, but an overabundance of things we consume for pleasure. Do we really need anothere streaming service, another photo sharing app, another Frappuccino variation at your coffee chain of choice (shameless plug for the Peanut Butter Cup Frappuccino tho)?","That's not to say that such products require less work to produce, nor that they are less valuable just because there are similar products on the market already. It's the aftertaste they leave behind. Whether we talk about the process of consumption or production of such products, they somehow lack a sense of novelty. And this novelty is lost right when we chose to stick with the trends. That's the moment we lose the ability to take chances.","This bias towards security arises when being confronted with the modern free market, in which a company's future is solely shaped by its financial performance. In order to peek through the endless amounts of content that we are drowning in, it has now become a necessity to copy. This trend is not only a burden for the unconscious mind of the end consumer, but also a concrete block on the feet of the creators who just want to elevate their skill set to the next level. Big players now encourage familiarity over originality due to the high financial risks associated with the production of triple A content. And this distinct level of familiarity is just enough of a dopamine hit to keep you on the hook. Just enough to keep you satisfied for the moment. But the sensation of experiencing something truly out of the blue is fading, just as our individuality surrendering to the tasteless amalgamation of repetitive content that will eventually lead to the incremental collapse of the traits that make us unique.","One of the positive side effects of such realisations is the freedom it gives to one's pursuits in life. In a world where survival is taken out of the equation, every path you take seems equally valuable (or rather expendable) for society. I believe we have arrived at a point, where creative tasks can be more valuable to yourself and your surroundings than a high tier position in a corporate setting. Both scenarios allow you to have some level of autonomy over the choices you make, but in my eyes the process of executing such decisions affects your deepest self in a totally different way. While the result of your business decisions can be measured through various performance metrics, the outcomes of pure creative pursuits are beyond such measurements - leaving the like economy of social media out of the picture for now. It resembles the true voice of a human being. An image of one's essence. An outlet to fill the emptiness of consumerism. Because there will never be an overabundance of expression.","Until next time!
