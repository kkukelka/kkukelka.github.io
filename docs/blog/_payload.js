It’s like us Westerners can’t help ourselves but to take consumerism to a degree at which it starts to become a parody of itself. We’ve managed to morph something as mundane as the act of food consumption into a classist system of oppression. In our modern-day food culture mere eating is to be considered an activity for peasants.

It took me a moment to open it as my hands were still slightly numb from the snowstorm that swept through the city. Sifting through the first few pages it dawned upon me what I’ve manoeuvred myself into. This wasn’t just your average woke fusion kitchen. This was meant to be an experience. A culinary triathlon if you will. My curiosity, however, faded away in an instant when I came to realise that none of their multi course meals were suitable for devout followers of a plant based diet. It was at this moment that the rest of the party arrived. The waiter was quick to take our orders, but before we could even say a word, we were being subjected to a 5 minute monologue about the exquisite selection of drinks that they had in store for us. The brash and presumptuous undertone to his suggestions was so blatantly obvious that I couldn’t even be mad about it. And to his defence, he was nothing but a pawn in the game of chess that had been going on since the moment I had stepped foot into the place.

What did bewilder me though was the taste of the food, or rather the lack thereof. Hear me out, I really gave it a shot. I genuinely was looking forward to experience the culinary sensation I was being sold on. First I mixed the hazelnuts with the cauliflower, then with the bread, then all of them together in a single bite.

I guess part of this financial abuse is being accounted for when being told by the minimum wage waitress how the minuscule slice of wagyu beef had been hand-massaged by a cohort of Tibetan monks before being flown half across the globe just to be devoured by a twenty-something year old junior business consultant with a self-acclaimed interest for fine dining despite ever having touched his 500$ Japanese knife set he bought himself for Christmas."}]},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I returned from my roundtrip shortly after.

The peach-coloured sorbet was to be eaten out of a tiny aluminium can, which originally was used as a storage container for sun-dried tomatoes. How do I know? Well, the hideous looking label of some no-name Slavic food producer still was attached to it. Presumably the chef’s attempt to convey a sense of frugality or pragmatism.

Putting my thoughts and emotions down into words seems like the only valid approach to finally come to peace with my inner demon. The issue at hand, and the very topic I seek to deconstruct throughout writing this essay, is my relationship with painting.

Hence, the artistic journey has become somewhat of an uphill battle to me, with the only thing keeping me going being the satisfaction I receive upon finishing a piece. Throughout the process itself, however, I either find myself in a state of complete apathy or at the beginning of a nervous breakdown. At first I thought this to be just the initial barrier one typically faces when picking up something new.

Perhaps the aspiration of becoming this idealised version of myself simply isn't enough of an incitement to keep myself motivated on a long-term basis.

What has emerged is a state of disorientation. A toxic cycle that, through its deceptive prospects of fame and success, manages to keep me stuck in place. I genuinely believe, however, that the given situation is not a product of a lack of discipline and that vigorously trying to rewire myself just for the off-chance of finding enjoyment is not to be considered an appropriate response to the dilemma I’m facing. That is because in virtually every other aspect of my life, these character traits of mine give me an edge I don’t want to miss. More often than not, I truly appreciate and welcome the way my brain tends to parse and process my surroundings. My mind is, and always has been, a captive to short-term gratification.

A luxurious good in current times. Because without it, what's a conversation even good for? So let's grab our adventure bags and hop on the quest of being the most honest self we can be. As with most of my journeys, the starting point is centered around self exploration. Only after we break the barrier of lies within ourselves, we are able to truly appreciate how us being honest can affect the lives of our fellow human beings.\nEvery time we lie to ourselves, we sort of create an anabranch of our current stream of life. And if we keep lying over and over again, it gets harder and harder to rejoin with the main stem of the stream. That is what you want to avoid at all cost. To let lying become a habit. There's a reason why pathological lying is a diagnosable mental disorder. We get lost in diversion and can't even tell what course we are on anymore. A lie may present itself as an easy solution in the short term, but eventually you will find youself tangled in a web of personal distress."}]},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"You may ask for a quick solution to help you out of this misery. But there isn't. You can improve, however - gradually - one step at a time. Yes, it will be uncormfortable at times. And once you are able to shield yourself against any potential shame and judgement you will encounter, it will become effortless. An extension of your former self. Time will pass and you will notice the potency of your harvest. It will let you move towards your goals in the most efficient way possible.

We try to avoid any scenario where this precious bonding is at harm, even if it would change things for the better. The power of words has never been more apparent. There is, however, a way of communicating your thoughts in a more sensitive way - call it consumer-friendly packaging if you will. You don't even have to implicitly tell them your thoughts, but rather help them come to the conclusion themselves. This can be achieved through burrowing subtle messages into your dialogues. Gently massaging them into the consciousness of your conversational partner. This way we don't have to confront people with a tsunami of truth. It's more like jumpstarting their journey of self-discovery. Whether its about relationship advice, important life decisions or tough financial situations. Most of the time, they already know the answer themselves.

As with everything else balance is important - everybody's ego deserves to have its moment. There are moments when you have to respectfully accept decisions that seem to be out of your control. You even might feel a sence of deception in the air. But I command you to uphold an honest relationship with your surroundings, as clarity will scatter the vicious fog of lies."}]}],toc:{title:h,searchDepth:g,depth:g,links:[{id:aa,depth:e,text:ab},{id:ad,depth:e,text:ae},{id:af,depth:e,text:ag}]}},_type:l,_id:"content:blog:the-yield-of-honesty.md",_source:m,_file:"blog\u002Fthe-yield-of-honesty.md",_extension:n},{_path:"\u002Fblog\u002Ffilling-the-void",_dir:j,_draft:d,_partial:d,_locale:h,_empty:d,title:"Filling The Void",description:y,excerpt:{type:i,children:[{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:y}]}]},subtitle:"On what's fueling us in a world of overabundance",author:k,slug:"\u002Ffilling-the-void",date:ah,updatedAt:ah,length:g,body:{type:i,children:[{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:y}]},{type:b,tag:f,props:{id:ai},children:[{type:a,value:aj}]},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Not one day goes by that I don't question the path that I'm currently pursuing.

Big players now encourage familiarity over originality due to the high financial risks associated with the production of triple A content. And this distinct level of familiarity is just enough of a dopamine hit to keep you on the hook. Just enough to keep you satisfied for the moment.

Both scenarios allow you to have some level of autonomy over the choices you make, but in my eyes the process of executing such decisions affects your deepest self in a totally different way. While the result of your business decisions can be measured through various performance metrics, the outcomes of pure creative pursuits are beyond such measurements - leaving the like economy of social media out of the picture for now.
