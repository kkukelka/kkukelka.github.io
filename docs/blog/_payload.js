When looking at the environment our ancestors had to survive in, roaming the planes of the South African wetlands, it stands to reason why we developed such tendencies in the first place. Back then, food was a necessity, rather than the hedonistic activity it has become today. One had to seize every opportunity to obtain sustenance, as scarcity and uncertainty were ever-present. But with the arrival of the Industrial Age, the invention of ever more capable machinery and ultimately the advancements in food manufacturing and preservation, humanity has effectively outpaced the speed of evolution in a matter of centuries.

Pointing your finger at the next best industry giant won’t aid you in pulling yourself out of your misery, as the suffering that plagues you is entirely self-inflicted. At its core, the modern culinary landscape is nothing more than a reflection of the collective demand. If you ever wondered why something like Hershey‘s giant 5 pound bar exists, it is because someone is willing to pay money for it. That’s just how consumer markets tend to work. Way more interesting to decipher are the motivational factors behind such purchases, which are rooted deeply in the way in which Western society puts consumerism above all. A mental construct that has been fed to the masses since the 18th century, as a means to counteract the overproduction of goods. Ever since, our day-to-day life and social norms have been meticulously tailored to fit this given narrative, making us utilize the act of consumption as a coping mechanism to fill the void that everyday life leaves us with.
