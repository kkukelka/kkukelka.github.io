The days when you weren't even aware of the steep hill you have to conquer in order to progress in your creative endeavours. The ease of being a child. What growing up has took from me is the effortlessness of creating. Building your new Lego set didn't involve thinking about the long-term benefits of playing Lego. Doodling your favorite Digimon character on a rainy afternoon wasn't followed by a 30 minute self-critique session. In some cases it may had the purpose of escaping reality, but more often than not playing was just something I did.

Everything has to result in something that can be measured in terms of progress - something that can be shared and talked about.

Maybe my small glimpse into the corporate world already speaks for itself. There seems to be this barrier between pure creative expression and the creation of value for an organisation. Don't get me wrong. I definitely have heard of projects in which team members complement and nourish each other in a healthy way. But such places seem like very rare occurrences. To me it isn't even feasible to chase after such outliers. I believe such clusters of like-minded people happen organically, in which case there is no point in looking for our dream positions.
