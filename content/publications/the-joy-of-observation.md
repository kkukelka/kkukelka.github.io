title: The Joy of Observation
description: Come and join Juliet on her daily odyssey through the never-sleeping streets of the concrete jungle. Feeding the birds at Wendriff park, indulging in delicious pastries at her favorite French Bistro, or leisurely sipping a latte at McCliffton's on 8th Street. Just make sure to not lose yourself in the superficiality of it all, as you will miss out on the beauty that is hidden in the mundanity of everyday life.
