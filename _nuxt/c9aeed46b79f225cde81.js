The thing is, after completing The Big Short for the 11th time and devouring my favorite scenes over and over again on youtube, I think by now it's not even about the plot anymore. I started picking up on weird patterns in conversations between characters, dissecting every single sentence word by word. Observing the camera movement, the editing, extras in the background. And the thing is, it all feels meticulously planned.</p>\n<h3>Loosing Control</h3>\n<p>Lets now focus on the camera movements for a moment. We can see some interesting cuts in between sentences.</p>\n<p>While Mark loses himself to the intricacies of the derivative marke the scene transitions from closeups to medium shots.</p>\n"}}}]);
