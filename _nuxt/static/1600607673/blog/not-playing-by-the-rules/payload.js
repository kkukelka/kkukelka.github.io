What I've picked up on throughout these conversations is a certain characteristic of mine that is still following me to this day. It is my inability to play by the rules. Wether it was about learning how to tie one's shoes or how to fold a shirt, I was never able to see a reason to follow the established way of doing things. Not as a rebellion against my parents. I just did things the way they felt natural to me.

I hated being told what to learn. I hated having to be present in a specific room in a certain time of the day for this period of time. I hated being there in general. I remember being sick every other week. Endless days of playing LEGOs at home, without anyone interrupting my way of doing thing - without anyone entering my world. School was torture for me. It wasn't about the other kids or having bad grades. It was about the structure that was set in place. I felt powerless.

I have some saying in how things should be done and I have the chance to make suggestions to my superiors when I'm unhappy with a certain process.
