All the hours I spent soul searching in the last few years seem to have gone to waste. Just when you think you have finally figured it out, your efforts suddenly lose all their meaning.

Once the option has been established, we have crossed the point of no return. Can you imagine the pushback when there are suddenly no bananas available anymore? When there is no imported coffee from across the globe on the shelves? I for one would be more than happy with such changes. But the vast majority of people doesn't seem to recognise the enormous carbon output it takes to transfer the ecuadorian chocolate nibs into their breakfast bowl (which itself was probably manufactured in a third world country of your choice)."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:k,props:{id:g},children:[{type:b,tag:l,props:{ariaHidden:m,href:"#the-sad-realisation",tabIndex:n},children:[{type:b,tag:o,props:{className:[p,q]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:h}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"What is truly sad is that we actually have figured it out.

We have lost some people on the way. But there's no sign of stopping the machinery of capitalism. There is a voice inside of me that actually wants to see society crumble - to witness the downfall evoked by our wrongdoings.

When there are entire corporations rooting for the wrong team, what power do I have as an individual? You are shouting against a brick wall. One may look at social media as a viable solution to amplify your voice, but even here the playing field is not even. You will eventually drown in a pool of meaningless content and purposely spread disinformation. It isn't about the message anymore, the real economic value is attention. And that's what our vision is missing. We cannot feed the program - it therefore cannot be catered to an audience of short-term thinkers and zombies of the status quo."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:k,props:{id:i},children:[{type:b,tag:l,props:{ariaHidden:m,href:"#finding-relief-in-the-chaos",tabIndex:n},children:[{type:b,tag:o,props:{className:[p,q]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:j}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"One a more positive note, 2020 has taught me a lot about what is truly valuable in life. How is a digital number stored on a bank server gonna help you with your inner demons? How is a new flatscreen TV gonna soothe your existential dread? What are we left with when shit hits the fan? Humans. While I was trapped in the rat race, it was my fellow human beings that I left out of the picture. The joy of sharing, talking or just simply sitting right next to your best friend.
