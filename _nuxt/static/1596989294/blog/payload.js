They already went through the same thought loops and came to important conclusions that my disoriented self soughs after. To stretch this assumption even further, my guess is that events in their early childhood and teenage years led such groups to have overlapping character traits and behavioural patterns. They went on to accumulate specific knowledge and interests that turned out to be especially useful in the profession they ended up in. Of course its hard to retroactively say if one's skills were aquired due to the desire to succeed in a certain profession, or if same profession just organically played into one's strenghts.
