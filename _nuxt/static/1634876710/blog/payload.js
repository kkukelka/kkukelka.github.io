Even though I'm providing value for the team and the project I'm a part of, I am not able to appreciate my doings on a personal level. This problem, however, comes along with a much bigger issue our society faces. Overabundance. Not only an overabundance of food and shelter necessary for our survival, but an overabundance of things we consume for pleasure.

This trend is not only a burden for the unconscious mind of the end consumer, but also a concrete block on the feet of the creators who just want to elevate their skill set to the next level. Big players now encourage familiarity over originality due to the high financial risks associated with the production of triple A content. And this distinct level of familiarity is just enough of a dopamine hit to keep you on the hook. Just enough to keep you satisfied for the moment.

I believe we have arrived at a point, where creative tasks can be more valuable to yourself and your surroundings than a high tier position in a corporate setting. Both scenarios allow you to have some level of autonomy over the choices you make, but in my eyes the process of executing such decisions affects your deepest self in a totally different way. While the result of your business decisions can be measured through various performance metrics, the outcomes of pure creative pursuits are beyond such measurements - leaving the like economy of social media out of the picture for now. It resembles the true voice of a human being. An image of one's essence. An outlet to fill the emptiness of consumerism.

A luxurious good in current times. Because without it, what's a conversation even good for? So let's grab our adventure bags and hop on the quest of being the most honest self we can be. As with most of my journeys, the starting point is centered around self exploration. Only after we break the barrier of lies within ourselves, we are able to truly appreciate how us being honest can affect the lives of our fellow human beings.\nEvery time we lie to ourselves, we sort of create an anabranch of our current stream of life. And if we keep lying over and over again, it gets harder and harder to rejoin with the main stem of the stream. That is what you want to avoid at all cost. To let lying become a habit. There's a reason why pathological lying is a diagnosable mental disorder. We get lost in diversion and can't even tell what course we are on anymore. A lie may present itself as an easy solution in the short term, but eventually you will find youself tangled in a web of personal distress."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"You may ask for a quick solution to help you out of this misery.

There is, however, a way of communicating your thoughts in a more sensitive way - call it consumer-friendly packaging if you will. You don't even have to implicitly tell them your thoughts, but rather help them come to the conclusion themselves. This can be achieved through burrowing subtle messages into your dialogues. Gently massaging them into the consciousness of your conversational partner. This way we don't have to confront people with a tsunami of truth. It's more like jumpstarting their journey of self-discovery. Whether its about relationship advice, important life decisions or tough financial situations.
