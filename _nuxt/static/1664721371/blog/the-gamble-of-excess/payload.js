Shit, I'm only halfway through this mess. What have I done? And then the feeling of failure slowly starts kreeping into my consciousness. Telling myself that I don't have the willpower to finish this damn thing. Knowing that I already invested hours of my life into this show. I don't know what part of evolution takes over at this point, but I honestly wish I could apply it on other areas of my life. So what happens is that all this morphs into some kind of coping mechanism where my brain comes up with the ingenious strategy to finish the whole season in one sitting in order to be liberated form this burden. This of course comes with the underlying notion of quitting streaming altogether from this day one, which turns out to never be as easy as it seems.
