This problem, however, comes along with a much bigger issue our society faces. Overabundance. Not only an overabundance of food and shelter necessary for our survival, but an overabundance of things we consume for pleasure.

Both scenarios allow you to have some level of autonomy over the choices you make, but in my eyes the process of executing such decisions affects your deepest self in a totally different way. While the result of your business decisions can be measured through various performance metrics, the outcomes of pure creative pursuits are beyond such measurements - leaving the like economy of social media out of the picture for now.

Is it the lack of analytical thinking on their part that is letting me down? Who knows. I guess when you strife for perfection in everything you do, you cannot rely on intuition alone. And this is one essential aspect of making music that blocks the inner workings of my brain. Well, there are ways to make music analytically. But its just not what I intend to do.

Not copying traits of their personality, but their perspective on life. Which seems to be all about enjoying the process. Not thinking long-term, nor short-term. Just enjoying the moment. Call me a spiritual nutjob, but I can see value in that.

They already went through the same thought loops and came to important conclusions that my disoriented self soughs after. To stretch this assumption even further, my guess is that events in their early childhood and teenage years led such groups to have overlapping character traits and behavioural patterns. They went on to accumulate specific knowledge and interests that turned out to be especially useful in the profession they ended up in. Of course its hard to retroactively say if one's skills were aquired due to the desire to succeed in a certain profession, or if same profession just organically played into one's strenghts.
