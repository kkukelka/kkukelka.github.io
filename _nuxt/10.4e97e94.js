Why are these morons waiting in line?",date:"May 3, 2020",length:3},html:"<h3>Six seasons</h3>\n<p>Who would have thought that having all 6 seasons of House of Cards at ones fingertips could turn out be the tipping point for ones sanity. I love the feeling of finishing things. Whether its of artificial nature like collecting x amount of y in a video game, or the the completion of this very essay. But when it gets to passive activities such as watching Netflix, something doesn't seem to work as intended in the mess called my brain.</p>\n<h3>The gamble of excess</h3>\n<p>The pattern starts out very innocent. I scroll through the seemingly endless stream of content. Maybe something will peak my interest. Oh, whats that. 3 notification on the bell-thingie. I better get ready for the latest iteration of <em>Sandinavian Detective Duo</em>.\nRarely it turns out to be a gem. Which I welcome. The occassional &quot;healthy&quot; binge that keeps you at the edge of your seat.\nMost of the time, however, 3 episodes in the show unmasks itself as the same bland, no-brand coffee capsule you cram into your Pixie machine every morning. Just enough of a push to get you going. You just wanna escape for an hour. Who can blame you?</p>\n<p>Now it's 9 p.m. and I realize what monstrosity I have awoken. I ESC out of fullscreen mode to take a glance at the progress bar (I honestly don't know what it's called ... ). Shit, I'm only halfway through this mess. How many episodes are still infront of me? What have I done? And then the feeling of failure slowly starts kreeping into my consciousness. Telling myself that I don't have the willpower to finish this damn thing. Knowing that I already invested hours of my life into this show. I don't know what part of evolution takes over at this point, but I honestly wish I could apply it on other areas of my life. So what happens is that all this morph into some kind of coping mechanism.</p>\n<p>And time and time again, I'll power through it.</p>\n<p>When you keep watching that one show just for the sake of getting it over with, you know something's off.</p>\n"}}}]);
