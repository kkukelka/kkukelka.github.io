Why are these morons waiting in line?",date:"May 2, 2020",length:5},html:"<h3>Observation</h3>\n<p>Lets talk about things that people line up for. Whether we look at the new restaurant in town or the latest iPhone release, humans are willing to wait for extended periods of time to fulfill their momentary desires. But what is it that those individuals really strife for in such situations. Is it the feeling of community, the fear of missing out, the experience of being part of something? Or is there something deeper to it? Some kind of coping mechanism.</p>\n<h3>Breakdown</h3>\n<p>When looking at products such as consumer electronics and clothes, one could bring up scarcity as a determining factor that drives people to line up for a new product release. What fascinates me in this particular case is that there is no existential need to buy such things as soon as they hit the shelf. In a sense there is no need to buy them whatsoever. People, however, seem to rationalize their act of waiting in line because of the fear of missing out. During tomorrows lunchbreak, Tessa will be drooling over her new shiny phone. And you are the one left behind. The one that missed her opportunity to shine.</p>\n<p>We can assume that lining up for stuff means that such stuff has some sort of mass appeal. this presumes that a product of this kind has to be liked by many people. in order to be like by many, it has to have a generic property of some type.</p>\n<p>therefore we can concludee</p>\n<p>As you can see, at this point my hypothesis kind of falls apart. But it was a fun thought experiment after all. Thanks for taking that ride with me.</p>\n<p>Until next time! XOXO Kilian</p>\n"}}}]);
